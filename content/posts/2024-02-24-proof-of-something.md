## Hello, world.

It's been a while since I had a publicly facing website, but here we are, I suppose.

For a while, I've kept a small group of peers up-to-date with what is happening in my little pocket universe of projects.
What with changes in my personal life though, I've been looking to relocate that group elsewhere. So that's what this is.

Even if things are unpolished or go nowhere, I think there is still value sharing that with the world. Over the years, I've come to figure out that the best way to keep the ball rolling, is to have a little show and tell once in a while. I've come to realize that I gain energy to work on something if someone else is willing to listen. Whilst I don't want to sound cliche _(I'm going to sound cliche)_, it's that burning passion; that little creature inside me with a craving to learn.

## The Future

There are some really, really cool things in the works this year, and I cannot wait to share more in-depth.

This year marks a number of 'firsts' in my life that are happening. It'll be the first time I have a project I've done, on a shelf in a store, which people can buy. That still blows my mind. I've been working with some absolutely brilliant people in the [Voron Design](https://vorondesign.com) and [Positron](https://www.positron3d.com) community on it. I'll write more about it soon; it's a lot.

Me and my partner just celebrated our first year 'togetherversary', as I like to call it. Later this year, we also hope to be joined by a new fluffy member of the family too. It'll be the first time keeping a pet since living away from birth relatives.

There's a possibility I might end up doing a few impromptu hangouts on Discord or YouTube livestreams. I suggest you keep an eye on [Steve Builds'](https://www.youtube.com/@SteveBuilds) YouTube channel for more; he's lovely. But, Felix and Oscar are the stars of the show! /jk

## Events in 2025

I'll be attending a few events this year. I'll add to this list if more come around.

### 3D Meetup Sweden

**29th - 30th March 2025 - Helsingborg, Sweden**  
_More info at [3dmeetup.se](https://3dmeetup.se)_

My first time going! I'll be bringing a Voron 0 with me, travelling on a train across Sweden.
It's got a secret sauce project stuck to the hotend, which I cannot wait to showcase.

### Printed World Conference

**22nd - 23rd May 2025 - Amsterdam, The Netherlands**  
_More info at [printed-amsterdam.com](https://printed-amsterdam.com)_

Let's be real, I need a vacation. A proper vacation. This isn't it, but I hope to go to this event if my actual vacation plans don't coincide. We will see. 

## Taking a Break

My last vacation was 2015 in Australia. I spent most of my time lurking around Brisbane city, sightseeing. It was the most relaxed I'd been in ages. But that was 10 years ago. I need a break, _really badly_. I'm planning a trip somewhere in Europe this year. Some place warm, with an infinity pool, and good culture. Yeah. Yeah.

### On Communities, Fandoms

For the best part of my adult life, I've participated one way or another in the furry scene quite actively. In 2023 I even tried to turn it into a business, but it sapped all the energy I had for it away. I'm back in a 'normal' job now, and I am quite honestly, mentally exhausted. I joined the scene circa September 2011, so about 13 and a half years ago. That is a long time! I've had a lot of fun in that time, but I'm taking a break now.

## 3D Printing has consumed me

Additive manufacturing... no, no. Addictive manufacturing.

I built my first Voron in 2023 after many years trying to find the time and funds to do so. Not gonna lie, I had a really bad time with it. The machine I built had so many teething problems from the first week of printing. The first major incident, the belts ripped off the toolhead during an overnight print with such force, it looked like someone had taken a pair of snips to them. I learned so so much in trying to fix it, but eventually, I had to let this one go, as difficult as it seems.

Maybe I'll do a write-up about that one day. But long story short, I think it was something of a human error. I sold that machine last year, and stepped back for a while to re-evaluate what it is I want to do in the printing community. In January, I built a Voron 0.2 with a kit provided to me by LDO Motors. Seriously, this is a night and day difference in how smooth it has gone. I love the little machine. It so smol.

### Satsuma 250 (Prusa MK3 to CoreXY conversion)

I'm working on an open source/open hardware conversion kit, to put a new lease of life on the older generation Prusa machines. I'm distracted on a side quest right now, but I will be returning to this project soon!

### Minature upside-down weighing scales attached to a fancy hot glue gun

Soon (tm).


That's all for now.
